# 🐢 Turtlesim “Catch Them All” — ROS 2 Project

This project implements an autonomous multi-node ROS 2 system using the **turtlesim** simulator.  
The goal is to control a master turtle (`turtle1`) that continuously seeks out, catches, and removes other turtles spawned in the environment.

Rather than focusing only on code, this project emphasizes **system design**, **clear separation of responsibilities**, and **correct use of ROS 2 communication patterns** (topics, services, and parameters).

---

## 📐 System Architecture

The system is composed of three ROS 2 nodes that communicate using topics and services.

A high-level architecture diagram is provided below:

> The diagram illustrates node responsibilities, data flow through topics, and request–response interactions via services.

## 🧩 Nodes Overview

### 1. `turtlesim_node` (simulation backend)

**Role:** Simulation engine and turtle lifecycle manager

- Provided by the `turtlesim` package
- Maintains turtle states (position, orientation, motion)
- Executes velocity commands for turtles
- Publishes pose data for controlled turtles
- Acts as a **service server** for:
  - `/spawn` — create new turtles
  - `/kill` — remove turtles from the simulation

This node represents the **environment** in which the system operates.

---

### 2. `turtle_controller` (autonomous controller)

**Role:** Motion control and target-seeking logic

- Controls the master turtle (`turtle1`)
- Subscribes to `/turtle1/pose` for real-time feedback
- Publishes velocity commands to `/turtle1/cmd_vel`
- Runs a periodic control loop using a **proportional (P) controller**
- Subscribes to `/alive_turtles` to identify available targets
- Selects a turtle to pursue (first or closest, depending on logic)
- Acts as a **service client** for `/catch_turtle` when a target is reached

This node contains the system’s **decision-making and control logic**.

---

### 3. `turtle_spawner` (population manager)

**Role:** Turtle creation, tracking, and removal coordination

- Periodically spawns turtles at random positions
- Calls `/spawn` to create new turtles
- Maintains an internal list of all currently alive turtles
- Publishes turtle names and coordinates on `/alive_turtles`
- Calls `/kill` to remove turtles when they are caught
- Acts as a **service server** for `/catch_turtle`

This node owns the **global state** of which turtles exist.

---

## 📡 Topics

### `/turtle1/pose`

- Publishes real-time pose (position and orientation) of `turtle1`
- Used by `turtle_controller` for closed-loop control

### `/turtle1/cmd_vel`

- Carries velocity commands generated by the controller
- Consumed by `turtlesim_node` to update motion

### `/alive_turtles`

- Publishes a list of currently alive turtles and their coordinates
- Enables target selection by the controller

---

## 🔁 Services

### `/spawn`

- **Server:** `turtlesim_node`
- **Client:** `turtle_spawner`
- Creates a new turtle at a specified location

### `/kill`

- **Server:** `turtlesim_node`
- **Client:** `turtle_spawner`
- Removes a turtle from the simulation

### `/catch_turtle` (custom service)

- **Server:** `turtle_spawner`
- **Client:** `turtle_controller`
- Signals that a turtle has been caught and should be removed

---

## 🧠 Design Notes

- Topics are used for **continuous state sharing**
- Services are used for **discrete actions**
- Each node has a **single clear responsibility**
- The architecture scales naturally with parameters and launch files
- The system design closely follows ROS 2 best practices

## 🚀 Future Extensions

- Add parameters (e.g. spawn rate, target selection strategy)
- Support multiple controllers
- Visualize performance metrics
- Package system using launch files and YAML configuration
